networks\n\nBootstrapping and attracting capital into a PoS network is difficult, especially for smaller chains. \n\n\nFor example, in the Cosmos ecosystem, consisting of over 60 application specific chains, initial annualized inflation rates of 20% to 100% are quite common. Such high inflation hampers the long term growth of the chain. 1\n\n\n\nVolatility. The cost of corruption for an attacker fluctuates based on the staked token's underlying price.\n\n\nCentralization. The assets of many PoS chains are concentrated in the hands of early investors, founders and team members and foundations, at least in the early stage of the projects. A concentrated asset exposes the network to centralization when the asset is staked to validate the network. 2 For example, approximately 91% of Toncoin tokens are concentrated in a few wallets, leading to concerns over centralization. While such high concentrations often suggest strong backing from major investors or early adopters, they also carry risks such as potential market manipulation or volatility. If large amounts of TON tokens are moved or sold by these holders, it could lead to significant price swings that may harm market stability. 3\n\n\nThese reasons are good enough for the rise of restaking, because it aims to eliminate the need for bootstrapping a project token and resolving the intricacies of maintaining its price.\nWhy do people restake anyways?\nLow utility of LSTs\nAs we explored before at Making sense of liquid staking, LSTs are tokens that represent the user's staking position, free to be transferred over for any purposes.\nStill now in the DeFi landscape, there is not so much utility with LSTs. Historically speaking, the deposit interest rate is surprisingly low compared to other unstaked versions of tokens. Let's take an example of wstETH on Aave over the past 365 days.\n\nThe formula of any autonomous yield-bearing system is simple: there needs to be a demand for the token to generate a yield. In the case of wstETH on Aave v3, there need to be people who are willing to borrow wstETH. However, there aren't just enough people who want to do it. Just let that sink that in for a second - why would you ever want to borrow wstETH instead of WETH anyways? Where are you going to use it?\n\nIn contrast, take a look at the historical borrow rate of USDC in the same Aave market. We can easily notice that USDC, being a stablecoin, has a lot more utility than wstETH.\nThis is a general pattern over any other staked asset across the network:\n\n\nYou can see that they are in a very low range of deposit and borrrow interest rates, typically ranging from 0% to 1%. This means there's not a big demand for these assets.\nIn comparison, observe that normally, other mainstream, unstaked assets would give tasty yields:\n\nAnd yes, you could potentially provide liquidity to Uniswap and earn fees, but that requires holding both tokens that form the pool. In fact, it seems that not a lot of people are interested in providing liquidity to wstETH pools or even swapping wstETH with something else in the first place. As of today, there are only two wstETH pools on Uniswap amongst the top 100 pools by TVL: wstETH/ETH at 17M TVL and 6.181% APR and another wstETH/ETH pool at 2M TVL and 0.867% APR.\nBalancer has a few wstETH pools too: \n\nwstETH/ETH: 0.4% base APR from swap fees, at 37M TVL.\nwstETH/AAVE: 1.19% base APR from swap fees, at 312M TVL.\nAnd many other exotic pairs.\n\nBut the point is that generating yield from swaps intrinsically exposes you to greater risks, first because you need to hold another token. For example, if you are an liquidity provider for wstETH/ETH, you are essentially exposing yourself to x2 ETH than when you would just hold wstETH. So in case of a price drop, you are losing double more money. This is worse for wstETH with an exotic pair, increasing the likelihood of impermanent loss. Also, there's much less reason to expect high APRs from a pool that swaps wstETH with an exotic pair, because it must not be too popular. This suggests that a rational investor who still wants to hold onto wstETH and create a pool to minimize risks, would most likely create a staking pool (namely, staked asset/unstaked asset, like wstETH/ETH).\nMoreover, the TVL of these staking pools across swaps is not big compared to other popular pairs that easily go over 100-200M TVL. This means that generally liquidity providers are less inclined to allocate significant capital to these pools compared to more popular or volatile pairs. Given this TVL, these liquidity providers represent only a very small proportion of the entire group of staked token holders who otherwise are not willing to use LPs to earn yield for their own reasons. If someone with a huge capital were to bring in liquidty into wstETH/ETH pairs, that is going to be another problem as well, because that will significantly drop the APR of the pool. All in all, we've discovered that:\n\nPeople are not really interested in swapping wstETH with something else, compared to other mainstream pools.\nPeople are not really interested in providing wstETH to a liquidity pool, to other mainstream pools.\n\nTherefore, while liquidity pools could certainly be used as an option for yield, it does not appear to be a very attractive option for those who hold staked tokens.\nPositive feedback loop in an expectation for rewards and airdrops\nSince LSTs won't hardly give satisfactory, risk-safe yields, people ran to EigenLayer and started depositing their idle staked ETH.\n\nIt only took a year for them to reach 1B in TVL! And now it's sitting at 14.3B. This definitely tells something about the idleness of staked tokens.\nEigenLayer only launched their mainnet on Apr 9, 2024. This is almost a year away from June 2023 when they first launched their stage 1, where hardly any core features of a restaking protocol were built. It was just a bare-metal deposit and withdrawal system without yields. But still, people ran and deposited, mainly in expectation for airdrop points. Increasing number of depositors led to even higher TVL, which in turn resulted in even higher expectation for project token price, which in turn brought in even more depositors who shared the same expectation.\nOther protocols saw a similar trend. To name a few, Symbiotic, Karak, Babylon, Solayer and alike. They all saw a great increase in TVL, which is incomparable to other DeFi protocols, which are usually in the unit of few tens or hundreds of millions only. Today, these are some of the top DeFi protocols by TVL in the world.\n\n\n\n\nRestaking landscape\nIn this section, we review how different restaking protocols have been evolving across different chains. The biggest premise of a restaking protocol is that it needs to support a major asset that has a market cap that is large enough to share an economic security. For this reason, the restaking protocols have been mainly developed on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\nEthereum\nEigenLayer\n\nSince its birth in 2023, EigenLayer's goal has been to sharing the security of an existing network, namely Ethereum mainnet. It provides decentralized systems with no additional cost of having to launch a project token. EigenLayer is the first restaking protocol ever to be created. Now in 2025, EigenLayer supports depositing more ERC20 tokens. However, Ethereum remains as the most dominant asset that is deposited:\nRestaked token distribution on Defillama as of Jan 31, 2025\n\nRestaked token distribution on EigenLayer App as of Jan 31, 2025\n\nApproximately, more than 95% of the restaked tokens account for staked ETH variants and $EIGEN token. This is an interesting point, because Eigenlayer clearly supports more ERC20 tokens, like below:\n\nThis may suggest that a restaking protocol's positioning strategy is important, as it is a signal that most users still tend to bring in Ethereum instead of other ERC20s.\nHow EigenLayer works\nThese are the few most important concepts in EigenLayer's architecture, which are also shared by other prominent protocols. Let's go into detail:\nRestakers. people who stake again their staked token to EigenLayer. This term has been diluted a little bit, as people also 'restake' plain, unstaked ERC20 tokens as well as ETH too. But we will keep calling it restaking and restakers to refer to the activity of delegating tokens of value to provide security for decentralized services.\nActively Validated Services (AVSs henceforth). decentralized service that has unique off-chain logics that are validated by on-chain contracts. The categories of AVS are seen below:\n\nA practical example of an AVS is EigenDA. It is an AVS developed by EigenLayer, which specifically takes care of data availability problems for modern rollups on Ethereum. Another example is Hyperlane, which is an interoperability protocol.\nEvery AVS is an on-chain contract for validation and an off-chain network of operators. [TODO]\nSlashing. Before EigenLayer, it used to mean penalizing dishonest or dysfunctional validators in a PoS network like Ethereum. Now, in EigenLayer, slashing refers to penalizing operators who secured an AVS that could not complete a task correctly by burning the restaked tokens.\nOperators. They run AVS and send the evidence of the execution on-chain to confirm the work. Restakers choose to delegate their tokens to specific operators. There are many operators on EigenLayer today. The primary reason for being an operator is an economic incentives in expectation for rewards for their operating jobs. By default, Operators will earn a flat 10% split on rewards. The rest of the reward is claimable by the operator's delegated stakers.\nIt's worth noting that the operators cannot directly transfer the delegated tokens, but they relate them to AVSs for slashing, so that when real slashing happens, the delegated tokens will be burnt. [TODO]\nRestakers choose to delegate their tokens to specific operators.\n\nA list of operators on EigenLayer.\n\nFree-market governance. As we will cover more later on, different operators will servce different risk appetites. In a sense, operators act like different vaults that are exposed to different levels of risks. For example, Operator A may serve AVSs that are prone to more slashing, resulting in higher rewards APR but higher chance of slashing (loss). In contrast, Operator B may serve AVSs that are more stable and less risky. These AVSs will tend to be less sophisticated and to run simpler tasks, resulting in smaller rewards APR and lower chance of slashing. \nPractically speaking, let's say Operator A delegates its restaked tokens to a bridge. Operator B delegates its restaked tokens to a decentralized system that calculates the sum of a two different numbers. It becomes pretty obvious that the chances of slashing is higher on the former case, and lower on the latter. The same goes for the rewards; Operator A would yield more rewards for its restakers, and B much less for its restakers.\nFor this reason, there remains a problem of finding an appropriate level of risk exposure to different AVS categories, because there are many operators, and EigenLayer does not offer a specific interface for comparing risks across different operators and AVSs. If you are interested in this problem, you might want to look into what YieldNest is doing: optimizing yield for the users by providing offers users controlled, liquid, and risk-adjusted exposure to curated AVS categories.\nNo native fungible token on EigenLayer\nAdditionally, EigenLayer does not mint a token representing the restaking position upon restaking (e.g., rstETH). This should be pretty clear if you have been following. The reason is that the risk exposure across different operators is different, so there can never be the 'same' restaked ETH.\nHowever, it is possible to get a liquid restaking token on other liquid staking platforms like Ether.fi, where Ether.fi itself will be an operator on EigenLayer, managing a set of AVSs. On Ether.fi, the restaking position delegated to its operator is represented as eETH. This is possible because there is only one type of risk exposure based on what AVSs Ether.fi operates. Holding this token will earn you staking AND restaking APR, as well as points across different DApps like EigenLayer.\nEigen token\n[TODO]\nSymbiotic\n\nSymbiotic has the same goal as EigenLayer: a marketplace for a pooled economic security. Networks will come to Symbiotic to borrow security, and restakers will supply that.\nSymbiotic's core participants.\n\nThere are a few differences from EigenLayer:\nCollateral. From its inception, Symbiotic has supported a wide range of ERC20 tokens. This led to more diverse ERC20 tokens other than ETH derivatives being restaked on Symbiotic than EigenLayer, although ETH derivatives account for the most TVL. For example, it has an lvlwaUSDC vault, USDC derivative on level.money.\n\nNetworks. This is what analogous what an AVS is on EigenLayer. It is any \"systems that need economic security to operate safely. These can be Layer 1 blockchains, Layer 2 solutions, or other decentralized systems that require stake-based security guarantees.\"\nVaults. There is no such thing as vaults on EigenLayer. Instead, EigenLayer leaves that responsibility to the external developers. If one wanted, someone could create something like YieldNest, but this would be outside of the core EigenLayer protocol.\nHowever, on Symbiotic, vaults are natively built into the protocol. Vaults are just like the traditional vaults in DeFi; different vaults have their own strategies to delegate the stake to operators and thus networks.\n\nAn example vault on Symbiotic that restakes wstETH, curated ER7 capital.\n\nDetailed information about the same vault, but more information on Mellow Finance.\n\nOperators. They are similar to what they are on EigenLayer. They are entities that operate validators, nodes, or any software for the network infrastructure. They are backed by restaked tokens in the vaults, and work on the operation of the networks.\n\nKarak\nKarak is heavily underdocumented. Skipping for now.\nSolana\nSolayer\n\nApproach. Solana is takes an interesting approach that is different than its counterparts on Ethereum. Its major focus is \"the hardware accelerated SVM blockchain\" as it is on their homepage.\nTheir direction is fundamentally different from EigenLayer and alike in the sense that they do aim to generate revenue as a protocol themselves by leveraging state-of-the-art tech. The revenue does not come from the restaking part; it comes from their own superior tech that enables:\n\nIncrease probability of securing block space\nPrioritized transaction inclusion\n\nSolayer team decided to tackle two of these problems. And note that this was only possible because Solana, being a very popular blockchain, is a battlefield for the users to compete for block space and transaction priority. So the problems that they are solving becomes increasingly valuable in the context of Solana.\nFor this reason, Solayer’s initial emphasis is on enhancing the capabilities of native Solana dApps, which they call \"Endogenous AVS\", meaning, AVS on Solana only. This is in contrast to EigenLayer or Symbiotic which serve what's called \"Exogenous AVS\", meaning any decentralized services that require stake-based validation mechanisms not necessarily related to a specific blockchain, such as oracles or bridges.\nWhy was this approach possible? This is because Solayer's team was so technically talented that they could write a hardware-accelerated, superfast SVM L1 blockchain from scratch. Personally speaking, I feel like this is the best approach amongst all restaking protocols, because there are still concerns as to if AVSs on EigenLayer or Symbiotic will generate enough revenue to return a satisfible return to all restakers. For the AVSs to be used, there needs to be enough demand. But that's up to the AVSs themselves to figure out. Then after all, restakers might not be able to get a sustainable yield on EigenLayer.\nRecognizing this problem, Solayer decided to leverage their tech talents to develop a protocol-native yield solution, which was to build a technically superior SVM that can be paid to be used by AVSs.\nArchitecture. The general architecture remains the same as EigenLayer and other prominent restaking protocols.\nPicasso\nPicasso is skipped for now.\nJito\n\nNode Consensus Networks. This is what an AVS is on EigenLayer.\nVRT. Liquid restaking token in Jito restaking vaults.\nBitcoin\nHow the blockchain of Bitcoin is not run on PoS, but still can be restaked.\nBabylon\n\nBig idea. It is a Bitcoin staking started with this problem:\n\nBitcoin is a Proof-of-Work chain but it is also a $600 Billion asset and most of it is idle capital.\n\nAnd the idea is very simple:\n\nWe propose the concept of Bitcoin staking which allows bitcoin holders to stake their idle bitcoins to increase the security of PoS chains and in the process earn yield.\n\nRationale. Bitcoin, being a PoW chain, has the following differences from PoS assets:\n\nUnused. The token of Bitcoin is not being used to secure the chain.\nIdle. Most Bitcoins need to be bridged over to other chains to generate yields. But there are risks and hassles to it. So most Bitcoins sit idle.\nMore decentralized. A common problem in PoS networks is that it is hard to evenly distribute the token amongst the network participants and users. Usually, the early movers will have the most tokens and thus the most stake. Concentration exposes the network to centralization risks. Bitcoin is fair and decentralized, although arguably inefficient.\nLess volatile. Volatility poses a risk to PoS networks in case of a significant price drop because the cost of corruption for an attacker would drop too.\n\nPoS Market. Babylon proposes a simple marketplace where BTC holders stake their BTC to PoS chains in need of economic security:\n\nThis is similar to EigenLayer where AVSs in need to economic security would bargin their rewards in exchange for restaked assets.\nArchitecture.\n\nThere are many things in the diagram, but it will suffice to understand that Babylon blockchain will be running to facilitate BTC staking, and its node will communicate through IBC Relayer for other chains to consume the restaked tokens.\nIt's important to note that in fact the restaked tokens do not get bridged over to the actual chains. When slashing happens, the restaked tokens on Bitcoin will be directly slashed.\nPell network\nWIP\nCurrent problems\nDemand for restaked tokens, revenue model, and product-market fit\nRevenues come from AVS and chains. But AVS should make enough money and pay it to feed all restakers.\nReferences\n1\nhttps://docs.babylonlabs.io/papers/btc_staking_litepaper.pdf\n2: https://docs.babylonlabs.io/papers/btc_staking_litepaper.pdf\n3: https://thecurrencyanalytics.com/altcoins/toncoin-price-rally-and-centralization-concerns-156100\n\n\n[Four Pillars] Restaking Stack: Categorizing the Restaking Ecosystem\n[Gauntlet] Inside the Restaking Ecosystem: Restaking Protocols\n[EigenLayer] Overview\n[EigenLayer] Whitepaper\n[EigenLayer] Eigen token Whitepaper\n[Symbiotic] Symbiotic docs\n[BlockSec] Can Symbiotic Challenge EigenLayer in Restaking?

The original concept of sharding comes from database design. It is a way to split a big database into smaller, manageable pieces.\nFor example: imagine you have a huge book of contacts. It's so big that it's hard to find anything quickly. Sharding is like dividing that book into smaller address books based on last names:\n\nBook A-G\nBook H-M\nBook N-S\nBook T-Z\n\nNow, when you need to find someone, you only have to look in one smaller book instead of searching through the entire giant book. This makes finding information faster and easier.\nIn database terms:\n\nEach smaller book is a \"shard\"\nThe data is spread across multiple servers instead of one big server\nThis helps the database handle more information and work faster\n\nWhen this concept is applied to blockchain, it enables multiple pieces of data to be processed in parallel. This makes blockchain significantly faster and more scalable.\nHow sharding affects smart contract design on TON\nBut there's a gotcha with sharding on TON:\n\nA smart contract is only allowed synchronous access to its own local state. Smart contracts cannot access other contracts' state because accessing the state cannot be synchronous and atomic.\nCalls between smart contracts are always asynchronous.\nUnbounded data structure needs to be designed as sharded contracts. This means if you had mapping(...) on Ethereum, you should expand this into contracts. For example, if the mapping(address =&gt; uint256) manages token balances of users, there would be as many contracts as users on TON, each representing a token balance belonging to each user. This way, multiple contracts can be processed in parallel\n\nThis is quite a huge change for any developers coming from EVM chains, because they don't have to worry about access to other contracts' state or having to deal with an asynchronous operation because there cannot be one on EVM.\nNow, we will review this concept with a practical example: Jettons.\nSmart contract design of Jettons\nJettons are the token standard on TON, just like ERC20 on Ethereum. \n\nThe code is open sourced at ton-blockchain/token-contract. \nThe standard is called TEP-74, viewable at ton-blockchain/TEPs. \nAnother relevant standard is the 'content' standard, TEP-64. This dictates the structure of the cell content stored in jetton-minter.fc. \n\nThe important contracts to look at are:\n\njetton-minter.fc\njetton-wallet.fc\n\njetton-minter\njetton-minter.fc is the 'parent' contract, that contains global information about the token, like total supply, name, symbol, and admin address.\nThe data stored in jetton-minter.fc are the following:\n\nload_data() returns 4 things: int total_supply, slice admin_address, cell content, cell jetton_wallet_code. \n\ntotal_supply is the amount of total tokens minted. \nadmin_address is the address of the admin who can control the minter contract.\ncontent is the cell of data that abides by TEP-64.\njetton_wallet_code is the actual code of jetton-wallet.fc contract. If someone who doesn't have a wallet yet receives a coin, he will receive the message with jetton-wallet code so his wallet can be deployed.\n\nget_data() returns the persistent contract storage cell. Remember everything on TON is stored in a cell. Then, begin_parse converts cell into slice. The reason is that all load_* methods only work on slice type, not cell. The data bits and references to other cells from the cell can be obtained by loading them from the slice. \nIn other words, a slice is a contiguous “sub-cell” of an existing cell, containing some of its bits of data and some of its references. Essentially, a slice is a read-only view for a subcell of a cell. Slices are used for unpacking data previously stored (or serialized) in a cell or a tree of cells.\nload_coins() returns total_supply of type VarUInteger16 = Coins. The expected serialization of $x$ consists of a 4-bit unsigned big-endian integer $l$ (denoting the length of the following value $x$), followed by an $8 \\times l$-bit unsigned big-endian representation of $x$. The serialization is only 124 bits long (not 128!). The maximum amount of VarUInteger16 is $2^{120} - 1$. Anyway, when it comes to manipulating the amount of Toncoin or Jettons, we always use load_coins() instead of something like load_uint().\nload_msg_addr loads MsgAddress. This function is used whenever you need to load a TON address stored in a cell.\nload_ref() loads a reference to another cell. In this case, loading cells containing content and jetton_wallet_code.\nNow, let's look at how the data is saved, which is just the opposite of load_data():\n\nset_data just takes a cell and sets it as persistent contract data.\nbegin_cell() is something special; it creates a new builder. Data bits and references to other cells can be stored in a builder, and then the builder can be finalized to a new cell by calling end_cell(). The reason we are using end_cell() is that the only possible parameter of set_data is of type cell, which is stored permanently by the contract.\nIf you want to know how you can serialize content into a cell, check out the code:\n\n\nbuildTokenMetadataCell is exactly how it is done. But because this is not the main goal of this post, we're not gonna explain this in detail.\nNow, let us look at recv_internal of jetton-minter.fc, which is a function that is invoked when an internal message arrives at this contract.\n\nNote that all of these function signatures are correct:\n() recv_internal(int balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) {}\n() recv_internal(int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) {}\n() recv_internal(cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) {}\n() recv_internal(slice in_msg_body) {}\n\nBut you can just use whichever function signature that best suits your purpose and gas fee management.\nThe function parameters are as follows (check 4.4.5 of TON Blockchain docs):\n\nint balance: The current balance of TON of the smart contract (after crediting the value of the inbound message) in nanograms.\nint msg_value: the amount of TON sent in the message in nanograms.\ncell in_msg_full: the inbound message passed as cell, containing the full message, including the message body.\nslice in_msg_body: the 'body' of the inbound message.\n\nIf you don't need some of the parameters, you can use the function signature with less parameters.\nThe first line of the function starts with slice_empty?().\nThis returns false if there is at least one bit of data or one ref (if you want to check if slice only has data and NOT refs, use slice_data_empty).\nBecause we don't want to process empty message body, we immediately return.\nNext, we process the flags. There isn't a lot of information about the \"bounced\" flag, but by looking at the code we can assume that the bounced flag is a single bit the end of the 32-bytes long flags. If it is bounced, it will be 1. If not, it will be 0. Like: 0b01010101011111.....1 (or 0).\nNext, the sender address is loaded by sender_address, op, query_id are loaded.\nNote that sender_address is from in_msg_full, while op and query_id are from in_msg_body, marking the beginning of the message body.\nThe message body's structure is always 32-bit (big-endian) unsigned integer op, followed by 64-bit (big-endian) unsigned integer query_id. Then the rest of the message body depends on the op.\nWe've already covered load_data(), so we pass on this one.\nNow, we are finally dealing with different ops. Each if statement handles one op.\nWe need to look at op-codes.fc first:\n\nop-codes.fc is included into jetton-minter.fc upon build, making op::* functions callable in it:\n\nAn opcode is nothing but a number. For example, int op::transfer() asm \"0xf8a7ea5 PUSHINT\"; means transfer has an opcode of 0xf8a7ea5. We will cover how this opcode is derived in the later section.\nDo note that it is also possible to define an opcode by using a newer syntax:\nconst int op::transfer = 0xf8a7ea5;\n\nLet's go back to if (op == op::mint()) and have a look at what's inside the if statement:\nif (op == op::mint()) {\n    throw_unless(73, equal_slices(sender_address, admin_address));\n    slice to_address = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();\n    int amount = in_msg_body~load_coins();\n    cell master_msg = in_msg_body~load_ref();\n    slice master_msg_cs = master_msg.begin_parse();\n    master_msg_cs~skip_bits(32 + 64); ;; op + query_id\n    int jetton_amount = master_msg_cs~load_coins();\n    mint_tokens(to_address, jetton_wallet_code, amount, master_msg);\n    save_data(total_supply + jetton_amount, admin_address, content, jetton_wallet_code);\n    return ();\n}\n\nthrow_unless(73, equal_slices(sender_address, admin_address)); will throw if sender_address is not equal to admin_address. The reason is pretty obvious; if new tokens can be minted by anyone, that is an immediate vulnerability. The error code is 73.\nThe labels of the error codes are located at JettonConstants.ts:\n\nFrom this, we know that the error code `73` means \"not admin\".\nThen, we extract necessary variables from in_msg_body: to_address, amount, master_msg. master_msg is another cell referenced from in_msg_body, so we begin_parse() it. Then, master_msg_cs acts as another message body, so we skip op and query_id. jetton_amount is loaded from master_msg_cs.\nOne oddity we could find is that amount needs to equal jetton_amount. \n\nThen, mint_tokens is called. This sends a message to to_address to mint a token of amount. We will look at how jetton-wallet.fc behaves when receiving this message later.\nLet's look at how mint_tokens is used:\n\n.store_uint(0x18, 6) stores 0x18 = 0b011000 first.\n\nFirst bit is 0, which is 1 bit prefix which indicates that it is int_msg_info.\nThe next 110 means \n\n1: Instant Hypercube Routing is disabled, \n1: messages can be bounced, \n0: message is not the result of bouncing itself.\n\n\n\nThen there should be sender address, however since it anyway will be rewritten with the same effect any valid address may be stored there. The shortest valid address serialization is that of addr_none and it serializes as a two-bit string 00.\nThen, total_supply is updated to total_supply + jetton_amount as expected, and we return an empty tuple from the function.\nAfter the summation, .store_uint(4 + 2 + 1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1) is the same as .store_uint(7, 108).\nThe meaning of 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1 is the following 1:\n\nFirst bit stands for empty extra-currencies dictionary.\n\n\nThen we have two 4-bit long fields. They encode 0 as VarUInteger 16. In fact, since ihr_fee and fwd_fee will be overwritten, we may as well put there zeroes.\n\n\nThen we put zero to created_lt and created_at fields. Those fields will be overwritten as well; however, in contrast to fees, these fields have a fixed length and are thus encoded as 64- and 32-bit long strings. (we had already serialized the message header and passed to init/body at that moment)\n\n\nNext zero-bit means that there is no init field.\n\n\nThe last zero-bit means that msg_body will be serialized in-place.\n\n\nAfter that, message body (with arbitrary layout) is encoded.\n\nNow, you must be wondering where this particular order of serialization came from. This rule in TON is called TL-B scheme. Let us look into that closely before going any further.\nTL-B schemes\nTL-B stands for Type Language - Binary. It is a language designed to describe the type system, constructors and functions. Even the message that we send can be described by TL-B because it has a certain structure: \n\nThis is MessageRelaxed type that we send as a parameter of send_raw_message. We note that the message has three parts:\n\ninfo\ninit\nbody\n\nWe will only deal with MessageRelaxed instead of Message for the purpose of explanation:\n\nmessage$_ is the constructor. Constructor tag is the postfix after the dollar sign: $_. In this case, _ means there is no prefix of any bits at the beginning of the structure.\nAlso, note that the type declaration is different from some languages like Typescript, where the name of the type is on LHS, like type MyType = number. In TL-B, that is reverse. \nIt refers to three different custom types:\n\n\ninfo:CommonMsgInfoRelaxed\n\nEither of the definition can be used. We can know that the message falls into either type when deserializing, by looking at the prefix. \nint_msg_info$0 starts with a 1-bit-long prefix of 0. Similarly, ext_out_msg_info$11 starts with 2-bits-long prefix of 11.\nEach Bool type accounts for a single bit, being either 0 or 1:\n\nMsgAddress and MsgAddressInt is defined as the following:\n\nNo need to digest everything about the address. For now, we just understand that this can be an address.\nNext is CurrencyCollection:\n\nWe don't care about ExtraCurrencyCollection for now because it's not used. Grams is defined as below:\n\nVarUInteger is simply var_uint$_ {n:#} len:(#&lt; n) value:(uint (len * 8)) = VarUInteger n;. So VarUInteger n is just another notation for saying \"An unsigned integer that is n bytes (not bits) long`.\nFrom the official paper detailing TON:\n\nIf one wants to represent $x$ nanograms, one selects an integer $l &lt; 16$ such that $x &lt; 2^{8l}$, and serializes first $l$ as an unsigned 4-bit integer, then $x$ itself as an unsigned $8l$-bit integer. \n\n\nNotice that four zero bits represent a zero amount of $Grams$. Recall that the original total supply of $Grams$ is fixed at five billion (i.e., $5 · 1018 &lt; 2^{63}$ nanograms), and is expected to grow very slowly. Therefore, all the amounts of $Grams$ encountered in practice will fit in unsigned or even signed 64-bit integers. The validators may use the 64-bit integer representation of Grams in their internal computations; however, the serialization of these values the blockchain is another matter.\n\nAfter that, ihr_fee and fwd_fee are also of type Grams, so we know what to do for them too. created_lt and created_at are simply uint64 and uint32 fields.\n\n\ninit:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))\nSo what are Maybe and Either?\n\nAccording to TL-B definition, when a type is Maybe X, it's prefixed with 0 or 1. When it's prefixed with 0, nothing is there for you to deserialize; it's an empty piece of data. When 1, it contains a value of type X. For example, (Maybe int32) can be just 0 or 100000000000000000000000000000011 (in binary) to denote 3 in decimal, where the leftmost bit is a prefix that tells that there is data.\nEither works in a similar way; if prefixed with 0, that means the data will contain X. If 1, the data will contain Y. For example, possible values of type (Either Bool int32) are: 00 (Bool and false), 01 (Bool and true), or something like 100000000000000000000000000000011 (int32 and 3 in decimal).\nBack to the original type, we have (Either StateInit ^StateInit). ^ means the field is a reference to another cell of the same type, instead of being an explicit field in the current cell.\nBut before Either, we have (Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit)), so this means that we might or might not have StateInit, and if we have it, it is either stored in the current cell, or a reference to another cell.\nStateInit is defined as follows:\n\nStateInit serves to delivery inital data to contract and used in contract deployment. The first field is split_depth, of type (# 5). # 5 means a 5-bit integer. For more, have a look at StateInit TL-B scheme. But as of now, split_depth, special and library are unused. code is contract's serialized code, and data is contract's initial data.\n\n\nbody:(Either X ^X)\nNotice that the first line of the scheme has message$_ {X:Type}. This is a parametrized type. We use this to mean the type of X can be determined at the time of using the type. When it is used to denote the type of another type, it can be used as (TypeName concreteType), like (MessageRelaxed Any) or (MessageRelaxed uint32):\n\nIf you have been following carefully, you should see that body:(Either X ^X) means a type of X, or a reference to a cell containing type X.\n\n\nMessage in mint_tokens\nNow, let's go back to the structure of message in mint_tokens:\n\nFirst, 0x18 is 0b011000, so we know that this message has int_msg_info$0 as the constructor of CommonMsgInfoRelaxed because it starts with 0, while others start with 10 and 11 (ext_in_msg_info$10 and ext_out_msg_info$11). And most importantly, int_msg_info means 'internal' message, which is a message to be sent in between contracts only. \nint_msg_info$0 ihr_disabled:Bool bounce:Bool bounced:Bool\n  src:MsgAddress dest:MsgAddressInt \n  value:CurrencyCollection ihr_fee:Grams fwd_fee:Grams\n  created_lt:uint64 created_at:uint32 = CommonMsgInfoRelaxed;\n\nThen:\n\nthe second leftmost bit is 1, which means ihr_disabled is bool_true$1. \nThe next bit is 1, meaning bounce is bool_true$1. \nThe next bit is 0, meaning bounced is bool_false$0.\nThe next two bits are 00, meaning addr_none$00 = MsgAddressExt; is used, because _ _:MsgAddressExt = MsgAddress;.\nstore_slice(to_wallet_address) means we are storing dest:MsgAddressInt.\nstore_coins(amount) means we are storing CurrencyCollection. Recall that ExtraCurrencyCollection is not used, so we only care about storing Grams. amount should actually be less than 120 bits long integer, according to the spec.\n.store_uint(4 + 2 + 1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1) means the following:\n\nFirst of all, the uint value to be stored is 4 + 2 + 1 = 0b111. Given the length of 108, it would actually look like this: \n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111\nThe first 1 bit means empty ExtraCurrencies dictionary; 0 stands for empty dictionary bit.\nThe next two 4-bit long fields are ihr_fee and fwd_fee. Full of 0.\nThe 64-bit field is created_lt. Full of 0.\nThe 32-bit field is created_at. Full of 0.\nThe next 1 bit is for the init field, because we are done with CommonMsgInfoRelaxed and at init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit)). And recall that when Maybe starts with 0, it means there is nothing, and if 1, there is something. In this case, we have our first 1. After that, we also have another 1, which means StateInit is stored in another cell.\nThe next 1 bit is for body:(Either X ^X). Recall that if the bit is 0, it means we're storing X in the current cell. If 1, in a reference to another cell. This bit is also 1, so we are pointing to another cell too.\n\n\n.store_ref(state_init) stores a reference to another cell of state_init. This makes sense because the first two bits of 11 tell us that we are storing StateInit in a reference.\n.store_ref(master_msg) stores a reference to another cell of master_msg. This makes sense because the last bit of 1 tells us that we are storing ^X, not X.\n\nLastly, send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 1); sends the message off. The second parameter is mode; 1 means paying transfer fees separately from the message value.\nBurn notification\nNow that we finally covered op::mint(), let's look at if (op == op::burn_notification()) {...}:\n\nFirst, we obtain jetton_amoutn and from_address the same way we do for the mint.\nNext, we have throw_unless:\nthrow_unless(74,\n    equal_slices(\n      calculate_user_jetton_wallet_address(\n        from_address, \n        my_address(), \n        jetton_wallet_code\n      ), \n      sender_address\n    )\n);\n\nLet's look back at the error code from JettonConstants.ts:\n\n74 equals unauthorized_burn. So we learn that the code checks if sender_address is an authorized address by comparing sender_address against the expected wallet address of this particular jetton.\nThe reason that we compare is that we want to make sure from_address, which can be manipulated by the sender, gives the same address when put into calculate_user_jetton_wallet_address.\nNext, save_data(total_supply - jetton_amount, admin_address, content, jetton_wallet_code); is to update the total supply because total_supply is decreasing by jetton_amount.\nNext, we load response_address by writing slice response_address = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();.\nRecall that a MsgAddress can be addr_none$00 constructor. That's why we are checking if (response_address.preload_uint(2) != 0).\nThen, we are building a message again. Let's break it down:\nint_msg_info$0 ihr_disabled:Bool bounce:Bool bounced:Bool\n  src:MsgAddressInt dest:MsgAddressInt \n  value:CurrencyCollection ihr_fee:Grams fwd_fee:Grams\n  created_lt:uint64 created_at:uint32 = CommonMsgInfo;\n\n\n\n.store_uint(0x10, 6). 0x10 in 6 bits = 0b010000. \n\nThe leftmost bit is 0, so we know that it's int_msg_info$0. \nThe next bit is 1, it means ihr_disabled is true. At the time of writing, hypercube writing is always disabled.\nNext bit is 0. Means the message shouldn't be bounced if there are errors during processing.\nNext bit is also 0. Means the message itself is not a result of bouncing.\nThe next two bits are 00, meaning src is addr_none$00.\n\n\n\n.store_slice(response_address) stores dest:MsgAddressInt.\n\n\n.store_coins(0) means storing nothing for grams:Grams part of CurrencyCollection.\n\n\n.store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1) stores a zero that is 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 = 107 bits long.\n\nThe first bit denotes storing nothing for other:ExtraCurrencyCollection part of CurrencyCollection (empty dictionary).\nThe next double four bits denote zero ihr_fee and fwd_fee. These will be overwritten.\nThe 64 bits are for created_lt, which is overwritten.\nThe 32 bits are for created_at, which is also overwritten.\nThe next 1 bit of zero means there is no init field; recall the type init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit)), and zero means there's nothing in Maybe`.\nThe next 1 bit  of zero means the body is directly serialized in the current cell, which follows custom layout.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the layout follows the typical structure of internal message body, which is to store 32-bit uint op and then 64-bit uint query_id:\n.store_uint(op::excesses(), 32)\n.store_uint(query_id, 64);\n\n\n\nThen the message is sent with a specific mode and flag: send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 2 + 64);. 2 means \"Ignore some errors arising while processing this message during the action phase\", and 64 means \"Carry all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message\". For more, have a look at the document on message modes.\n\n\nAnd you might be wondering, why is there no code to reduce the balance of the sender_address? This is because the burn is already done from jetton-wallet.fc. That is specifically why this operation is called op::burn_notification(), because the message comes from jetton-wallet.fc after it burns its own balance. We will look at how the wallet works in a second.\nAdmin operations\nThe rest of the operations are pretty simple:\nif (op == 3) { ;; change admin\n    throw_unless(\n      73, \n      equal_slices(sender_address, admin_address)\n    );\n    slice new_admin_address = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();\n    save_data(\n      total_supply, \n      new_admin_address, \n      content, \n      jetton_wallet_code\n    );\n    return ();\n}\n\nif (op == 4) { ;; change content, delete this for immutable tokens\n    throw_unless(\n      73, \n      equal_slices(sender_address, admin_address)\n    );\n    save_data(\n      total_supply, \n      admin_address, \n      in_msg_body~load_ref(), \n      jetton_wallet_code\n    );\n    return ();\n}\n\nThese are just administrative operations that can only be called by admin_address. It will update the persistent storage of the contract accordingly.\nGet methods\nThe last two functions are get methods, to be called outside of blockchain:\n\nThe methods are very self-explanatory. get_jetton_data returns the data stored on the persistent storage of the jetton minter (parent) contract. get_wallet_address returns the address of user's jetton wallet based on the user's address.\nReferences\n1\n[TON docs] Message layout\n\n\n[TON Blog] How to shard your TON smart contract and why - studying the anatomy of TON's Jettons\n[TON Blog] Six unique aspects of TON Blockchain that will surprise Solidity developers\n[Excalidraw] Contracts design diagram\n[Github] awesome-ton-smart-contracts\n[Github] block.tlb\n[Github] jetton-wallet.fc\n[Github] jetton-minter.fc\n[Youtube] Technical Demo: Sharded Smart Contract Architecture for Smart Contract Developers\n[PDF] TVM Whitepaper\n\n","id":"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/how-jettons-work-on-ton-with-sharding-in-mind-part-1/","title":"How Jettons work on TON with sharding in mind (Part 1)"},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/how-jettons-work-on-ton-with-sharding-in-mind-part-2/":{"body":"jetton-wallet\nNow, we have a look at jetton-wallet.fc, which is the 'child' contract of jetton.\nLet us start with the TL-B scheme of storage:\n\nThe storage contains balance, owner_address, jetton_master_address, and jetton_wallet_code. Should be self-explanatory. Recall that jetton_wallet_code is the compiled code of jetton-wallet.\nload_data() loads all information stored:\n\nsave_data does the opposite:\n\npack_jetton_wallet_data does nothing but to store the data into a cell, which was the same for jetton-minter. Recall that this is because we can only store a cell:\n\nNow, let us start from recv_internal, which is invoked when the contract receives an internal message:\n\nOn bounce\nFrom the previous section explaining jetton-minter, we know that the 4th bit is bounced:Bool:\n\nThat is why we are checking the 4th bit of the message in the code:\nslice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();\nint flags = cs~load_uint(4);\nif (flags &amp; 1) {\n  on_bounce(in_msg_body);\n  return ();\n}\n\non_bounce function is defined here:\n\n\nin_msg_body~skip_bits(32); ;; 0xFFFFFFFF: we do this because the body of the bounced message will contain 32 bit 0xffffffff followed by 256 bit from original message.\nwe load the data with load_data().\nthe original op is retrieved by int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);. Recall that the structure of the message body is 32 bits of operation followed by 64 bits of query id.\nthrow_unless(709, (op == op::internal_transfer()) | (op == op::burn_notification())); throws if the bounced operation isn't internal transfer or burn notification. The error code is static invalid_op = 709.\nint query_id = in_msg_body~load_uint(64); is loaded to get past the 64 bits.\nint jetton_amount = in_msg_body~load_coins(); loads the amount that was sent in the message body.\nThe amount is credited again back to balance and written to the storage. This prevents failed messages from falsely deducting the balance. balance += jetton_amount;\nsave_data(balance, owner_address, jetton_master_address, jetton_wallet_code);\n\n\n\nWe will understand this function better once we look at send_tokens and burn_tokens functions.\nop::transfer\nNext, we prepare arguments to use. Recall the int_msg_info$0 constructor and its scheme. We are fast forwarding up to the end of fwd_fee:Grams in src:MsgAddressInt dest:MsgAddressInt value:CurrencyCollection ihr_fee:Grams fwd_fee:Grams:\n\nmuldiv(cs~load_coins(), 3, 2) means floor(cs~load_coins() * 3 / 2), meaning it wants to get 1.5 times the original message's fwd_fee. muldiv is a multiple-then-divide operation. The intermediate result is stored in 513-bit integer, so it won't overflow if the actual result fits into a 257-bit integer. 1\nThe forward fee is for outgoing messages (any messages that go out of a contract).\nNow when the opcode is op::transfer, we call send_tokens:\n\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n\nNote the TL-B schemes above send_tokens declaration:\ntransfer constructor is the message coming from the user's master wallet into this jetton wallet.\ninternal_transfer constructor is the message going out of this jetton wallet.\n\n\n\nint query_id = in_msg_body~load_uint(64);. Remember we already loaded the opcode, so the next up is 64-bits  long query_id.\n\n\nThe rest of in_msg_body is customizable. We can find the rest of the body at wrappers/JettonWallet.ts:\n\nAfter query_id, jetton_amount, specifying the amount to send, is stored by int jetton_amount = in_msg_body~load_coins();. Same for to_owner_address. The rest of the cell structure is pretty self-explanatory. Just refer to this while reading send_tokens.\n\n\nforce_chain(to_owner_address);\n\nThe reason for calling this function can be traced back to the comment at the top of jetton-wallet.fc file:\n\nThe TON Blockchain consists of one masterchain and up to $2^32$ workchains. Each workchain is a separate chain with its rules. Each workchain can further split into 260 shardchains, or sub-shards, containing a fraction of the workchain's state. Currently, only one workchain is operating on TON - Basechain 2. The Basechain has an workchain_id of 0.3\nSo the default mode is always transferring within the same workchain; and without changing this line, the jetton will always be forced to be sent to the same workchain.\nparse_std_addr returns the workchain id and account id. int workchain() asm \"0 PUSHINT\"; just means declaring a zero integer variable. Why zero? because we know that there is only one chain right now, which is the Basechain. And its workchain id is 0. So if to_owner_address is from another workchain whose workchain id isn't 0, throw_unless(333, wc == workchain()); will throw.\n\n\n(int balance, slice owner_address, slice jetton_master_address, cell jetton_wallet_code) = load_data();. Load the data.\n\n\nbalance -= jetton_amount;. Deduct the amount being transferred.\n\n\nthrow_unless(705, equal_slices(owner_address, sender_address));. Throw if the message didn't come from the owner's wallet.\n\n\nthrow_unless(706, balance &gt;= 0);. Throw if the balance is insufficient.\n\n\ncell state_init = calculate_jetton_wallet_state_init(to_owner_address, jetton_master_address, jetton_wallet_code);. \n\nDon't know why the cell structure looks like this? Back to the TL-B scheme.\n\n\nstore_uint(0, 2). Two bits of zeroes mean there's nothing in split_depth and special. So we go past them.\nstore_dict(jetton_wallet_code). You might be wondering why store_dict instead of something like store_ref, because it's a cell? Well, store_dict actually looks like builder store_dict(builder b, cell c) asm(c b) \"STDICT\"; and stores dictionary D represented by cell c or null into builder b. In other words, stores 1-bit and a reference to c if c is not null and 0-bit otherwise. 3 So it's a perfect use case for short-circuiting Maybe ^Cell at once, because Maybe requires 1 to be prefixed if there is something in it. For that reason, store_maybe_ref is equivalent to store_dict`.\n.store_dict(pack_jetton_wallet_data(0, owner_address, jetton_master_address, jetton_wallet_code))\n.store_uint(0, 1). This is library:(Maybe ^Cell). \n\n\n\nslice to_wallet_address = calculate_jetton_wallet_address(state_init);. \n\ncalculate_jetton_wallet_address takes the result of calculate_jetton_wallet_state_init and returns a wallet address. to_wallet_address will be dest:MsgAddressInt in int_msg_info$0, so we will need to refer to MsgAddressInt when looking into this.\n\n\nstore_uint(4, 3). It stores 0b100. The first 0b10 is for addr_std$10 prefix. The next 0 is for Maybe, to say that there is none.\n.store_int(workchain(), 8). Store a 8-bit long workchain id, which is 0b00000000. The workchain id is a signed 32-bit integer, but addr_std dictates that workchain_id needs to be int8 in this specific type.\ncell_hash returns 256-bit uint hash of a cell. state_init is composed of jetton_wallet_code, owner_address, and jetton_master_address, so every jetton wallet address is practically unique, because if it were a different jetton, owner, or a jetton creator, the hash would be different. This is address:bits256.\n\n\n\nslice response_address = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr(); This is response_destination:MsgAddress of transfer constructor.\n\n\ncell custom_payload = in_msg_body~load_dict(); is custom_payload:(Maybe ^Cell) of transfer constructor. We use load_dict() here to load Maybe ^Cell, because it can be used for values of arbitrary Maybe ^Y types or a dictionary.\n\n\nint forward_ton_amount = in_msg_body~load_coins(); is loading forward_ton_amount:(VarUInteger 16). Note that VarUInteger 16 means $128 - 8 = 120$ bits of uint.\n\n\nthrow_unless(708, slice_bits(in_msg_body) &gt;= 1);. slice_bits(in_msg_body) will check if there is any remaining data if slice_bits(in_msg_body) &gt;= 1 is not true. This can happen in case of a malformed forward payload. For example, if forward_payload:(Either Cell ^Cell) is not included in in_msg_body at all, this would throw because slice_bits(in_msg_body) == 0.\n\n\nNow that we checked that there's a remaining part of the message, we safely call slice either_forward_payload = in_msg_body;.\n\n\nWe are now very used to this structure of cell; No explanation needed. This is info:CommonMsgInfoRelaxed and init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit)).\nvar msg = begin_cell()\n    .store_uint(0x18, 6)\n    .store_slice(to_wallet_address)\n    .store_coins(0)\n    .store_uint(4 + 2 + 1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1)\n    .store_ref(state_init);\n\n\n\nThen, we construct the message body. We specify the opcode and query id. Then we store some variables based on the TL-B scheme provieded at the top of send_tokens function:\nquery_id:uint64 amount:(VarUInteger 16) from:MsgAddress\nresponse_address:MsgAddress\nforward_ton_amount:(VarUInteger 16)\nforward_payload:(Either Cell ^Cell) \n= InternalMsgBody;\n\n\n\nmsg = msg.store_ref(msg_body);. msg_body is stored in msg as a reference.\n\n\nforward fee. There will be three messages that will be created at maximum:\nint fwd_count = forward_ton_amount ? 2 : 1;\nthrow_unless(709, msg_value &gt;\nforward_ton_amount +\n;; 3 messages: wal1-&gt;wal2,  wal2-&gt;owner, wal2-&gt;response\n;; but last one is optional (it is ok if it fails)\nfwd_count * fwd_fee +\n(2 * gas_consumption() + min_tons_for_storage()));\n;; universal message send fee calculation may be activated here\n;; by using this instead of fwd_fee\n;; msg_fwd_fee(to_wallet, msg_body, state_init, 15)\n\n\nmessage from owner_address to to_wallet_address\nmessage from to_wallet_address to the owner of to_wallet_address for transfer notification.\nmessage from to_wallet_address to response_address for excess mesasge. Only sent if any ton coins are left after paying the fees.\n\nWe will get back to the forwarding fee later. For now, just note that we are checking if we have enough TON sent for forwarding, gas and storage.\n\n\nsend_raw_message(msg.send_cell(), 64). 64 means \"carry all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message\".\n\n\nsave_data(balance, owner_address, jetton_master_address, jetton_wallet_code);. Finally, the updated balance is saved.\n\n\nop::internal_transfer\nReferences\n1\n[TON docs] Integer operations\n\n2\n[TON docs] Shards\n\n3\n[TON docs] store_dict\n\n[TON Blog] How to shard your TON smart contract and why - studying the anatomy of TON's Jettons\n[TON Blog] Six unique aspects of TON Blockchain that will surprise Solidity developers\n[Excalidraw] Contracts design diagram\n[Github] awesome-ton-smart-contracts\n[Github] block.tlb\n[Github] jetton-wallet.fc\n[Github] jetton-minter.fc\n[Youtube] Technical Demo: Sharded Smart Contract Architecture for Smart Contract Developers\n","id":"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/how-jettons-work-on-ton-with-sharding-in-mind-part-2/","title":"How Jettons work on TON with sharding in mind (Part 2)"},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/liquidation-math-on-a-defi-lending-protocol-how-much-to-liquidate/":{"body":"Liquidation in DeFi lending occurs when a borrower's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeds the protocol's liquidation threshold, either due to a drop in collateral value or an increase in the borrowed asset's value. This mechanism protects the platform's solvency by ensuring loans remain adequately backed. \nWhen the threshold is breached, smart contracts allow anyone to trigger liquidation, repaying part of the debt and receiving collateral plus a bonus as an incentive. This process mitigates insolvency risks caused by market volatility.\nBut for this specific post, let's talk about how to calculate the exact amount to be repaid in liquidation. I'm simply writing about this because no one on the Internet is talking about this, but this is much needed information when you are configuring your own liquidator or lending protocol. Otherwise, you will have to 'brute force' the amount to liquidate, which is definitely something that you don't want.\nBorrow factor\nReview these docs:\n\nKamino Finance\nEuler Finance\n\nA borrow factor is a risk-adjusted borrowing capacity ratio assigned to each asset. We follow Euler Finance's convention: it is the percentage of the asset that can be borrowed against a certain amount of collateral. It saves a room for price fluctuations in case of liquidation. Essentially, it has the same goal as the liquidation threshold in some of the other protocols, which is to protect borrowers from sharp price fluctuations and potential liquidations. \nFor example, given this table below:\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor90%90%\nBorrow factor70%100%\nPrice5 USD1 USD\n\nDeposit USDT, borrow TON:\n\nYou deposit 100 USDT = 100 USD\nWhen you want to borrow TON, you can only borrow (original value of collateral) x (collateral factor of the collateral) x (borrow factor of the borrowing asset) = 100 x 0.9 x 0.7 = 63 USD.\n\nDeposit TON, borrow USDT:\n\nYou deposit 20 TON = 100 USD\nWhen you want to borrow USDT, you can only borrow (original value of collateral) x (collateral factor of the collateral) x (borrow factor of the borrowing asset) = 100 x 0.9 x 1 = 90 USD.\n\nGenerally speaking, the borrow factor helps manage risk within the protocol by accounting for volatility. Lower borrow factors are assigned to more volatile assets, allowing less borrowing against them, while more stable assets may have higher borrow factors.\nCollateral factor and collateralization ratio\nWhen a user is withdrawing or borrowing, the protocol uses the collateral factor as well as borrow factor to check if the user is still overcollateralized after withdrawal or borrowing. The collateral factor on other protocols is also sometimes called \"LTV\", which stands for loan-to-value. \nBorrow and collateral factors work together to represent collateralization of a user, which is called \"collateralization ratio\":\n$$\n\\text{Collateralization ratio} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Collateral Factor}_i \\times \\text{Collateral Value in USD}_i)}{\\sum (\\frac{\\text{Borrowing Value in USD}_i}{\\text{Borrow Factor}_i })}\n$$\nwhere $0 \\leq \\text{Collateral factor} \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq \\text{Borrow factor} \\leq 1$.\nFor example, given the following table:\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor90%90%\nBorrow factor70%100%\nPrice5 USD1 USD\nDeposited amount5 USD1 USD\nBorrowed amount2 USD0.3 USD\n\nThe collateralization ratio would be:\n$$\n\\text{Collateralization ratio} = \\frac{(0.9 \\times 5) + (0.9 \\times 1)}{\\frac{2}{0.7} + \\frac{0.3}{1.0}} = \\frac{(4.5) + (0.9)}{\\frac{2}{0.7} + 0.3} = \\frac{5.4}{2.857 + 0.3} = \\frac{5.4}{3.157} = 1.71... &gt; 0\n$$\nIn this case, the collateralization ratio is bigger than 0, so this can be the state of the user after user has successfully withdrawn or borrowed some amount from a fully functional protocol. The user needs to keep the collateralization ratio above 1.\nFor liquidation, the health factor is calculated instead.\n$$\n\\text{Health factor} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Collateral Factor}_i \\times \\text{Collateral Value in USD}_i)}{\\sum \\text{Borrowing Value in USD}_i}\n$$\nThe health factor is always bigger than or equal to the collateralization ratio because we take the borrow factor out, which always deflates the result of the equation. When they are equal, they will always be at the positive infinity.\nUsing the information from the table above, the health factor would be:\n$$\n\\text{Health factor} = \\frac{(0.9 \\times 5) + (0.9 \\times 1)}{2 + 0.3} = \\frac{(4.5) + (0.9)}{2.3} = \\frac{5.4}{2.3} = 2.347\n$$\nAs it can be seen, the health factor is greater than the collateralization ratio. The difference between the health factor and the collateralization ratio is a buffer for the borrowers. When the health factor goes below 1, anyone can liquidate that user and make it back to 1 or closer to 1.\nHow much to pay for liquidation\nThe liquidation must happen before the health factor drops 'too much'. What would be 'too much'?: When the value of the collateral is so little that the health factor cannot be recovered back to 1 even after being liquidated. How do we derive the equation? We can use the same health factor equation we have above.\nLet's give an example using the variables below, and let's say we are repaying USDT debt and taking away TON collateral during liquidation:\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor (liquidation threshold)80%85%\nDeposited amount in USD5.4 USD0.1 USD\nBorrowed amount in USD0.1 USD5 USD\nLiquidation bonus6%7%\n\nLet's expand:\n$$\n\\text{Health factor} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Collateral Factor}_i \\times \\text{Collateral Value in USD}_i)}{\\sum \\text{Borrowing Value in USD}_i}\n$$\ninto\n$$\n\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}} = \\frac{CF_{TON} \\times (CV_{TON} - RV_{USDT}(1 + LF_{TON})) + CF_{USDT} \\times CV_{USDT}}{DV_{TON} + DV_{USDT} - RV_{USDT}}\n$$\nwhere\n\n$\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}$ is the health factor after liquidation takes place.\n$\\text{CF}_{asset}$ is the collateral factor of an $asset$.\n$\\text{CV}_{asset}$ is the value of an $asset$ deposited as a collateral in USD.\n$\\text{RV}_{asset}$ is the value of repayment on the debt of an $asset$ in USD.\n$\\text{DV}_{asset}$ is the value of the debt of an $asset$ in USD.\n$\\text{LF}_{asset}$ is the liquidation bonus factor of an $asset$.\n\nNotice that the equation is just an equation for the health factor in the post-liquidation state. $CF_{TON} \\times (CV_{TON} - RV_{USDT}(1 + LF_{TON}))$ represents the discounted collateral left after a part of TON collateral including the liquidation bonus is captured in exchange for the USDT debt repayment by the liquidator. $CF_{USDT} \\times CV_{USDT}$ represents the discounted USDT collateral. $DV_{TON} + DV_{USDT} - RV_{USDT}$ represents total debt after the USDT debt repayment.\nLet's rearrange the equation so we can solve for $\\text{RV}_{USDT}$:\n$$\n\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}} = \\frac{CF_{TON} \\times (CV_{TON} - RV_{USDT}(1 + LF_{TON})) + CF_{USDT} \\times CV_{USDT}}{DV_{TON} + DV_{USDT} - RV_{USDT}}\n$$\n$$\n\\implies \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(DV_{TON}) + \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(DV_{USDT}) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(RV_{USDT})\n$$\n$$\n= (CF_{TON})(CV_{TON}) - (RV_{USDT})(CF_{TON})(1 + LF_{TON})) + (CF_{USDT})(CV_{USDT})\n$$\n$$\n\\implies (RV_{USDT})(CF_{TON})(1 + LF_{TON})) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(RV_{USDT}\n$$\n$$\n= -\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(DV_{TON}) -\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(DV_{USDT}) + (CF_{TON})(CV_{TON}) + (CF_{USDT})(CV_{USDT})\n$$\n$$\n\\implies (RV_{USDT})((CF_{TON})(1 + LF_{TON})) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}})\n$$\n$$\n= -\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(DV_{TON} + DV_{USDT}) + \\sum\\limits_{i}{(CF_i \\times CV_i)}\n$$\n$$\n\\implies (RV_{USDT})((CF_{TON})(1 + LF_{TON})) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}})\n$$\n$$\n= -\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(\\sum\\limits_{i}{DV_i}) + \\sum\\limits_{i}{(CF_i \\times CV_i)}\n$$\n$$\n\\implies RV_{USDT} = \\frac{-\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(\\sum\\limits_{i}{DV_i}) + \\sum\\limits_{i}{(CF_i \\times CV_i)}}{((CF_{TON})(1 + LF_{TON})) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}}\n$$\nNow that we have the equation ready, substitute the variables. We know that:\n$$\n\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}} \\le 1\n$$\n, so let's substitute:\n$$\n\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}} = 1\n$$\nin this equation below:\n$$\nRV_{USDT} = \\frac{-(1)(5 + 0.1) + (0.8 \\times 5.4 + 0.85 \\times 0.1)}{((0.8)(1 + 0.06)) - 1}\n$$\nWe can run this Python script to confirm the result:\nRV_USDT_NUMERATOR = (-1 * (0.1 + 5) + (0.8 * 5.4 + 0.85 * 0.1))\nRV_USDT_DENOMINATOR = ((0.8) * (1 + 0.06) - 1)\nRV_USDT = RV_USDT_NUMERATOR / RV_USDT_DENOMINATOR\n\nprint(RV_USDT_NUMERATOR)\nprint(RV_USDT_DENOMINATOR)\nprint(RV_USDT)\n\nHF_CHECK_NUMERATOR = 0.8 * (5.4 - RV_USDT * (1 + 0.06)) + 0.85 * 0.1\nHF_CHECK_DENOMINATOR = 5.1 - RV_USDT\nHF = HF_CHECK_NUMERATOR/HF_CHECK_DENOMINATOR\n\nprint(HF_CHECK_NUMERATOR)\nprint(HF_CHECK_DENOMINATOR)\nprint(HF)\n\nThe console will print:\n-0.6949999999999994 # RV_USDT_NUMERATOR\n-0.1519999999999999 # RV_USDT_DENOMINATOR\n4.57236842105263 # RV_USDT\n0.5276315789473698 # HF_CHECK_NUMERATOR\n0.5276315789473696 # HF_CHECK_DENOMINATOR\n1.0000000000000004 # HF\n\nDisregarding the floating point number errors, we can confirm that we deduced the correct $RV_{USDT}$.\nWe can now generalize the equation further, from:\n$$\nRV_{USDT} = \\frac{-\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(\\sum\\limits_{i}{DV_i}) + \\sum\\limits_{i}{(CF_i \\times CV_i)}}{((CF_{TON})(1 + LF_{TON})) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}}\n$$\nto:\n$$\nRV_{\\text{repaid asset}} = \\frac{-\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(\\sum\\limits_{i}{DV_i}) + \\sum\\limits_{i}{(CF_i \\times CV_i)}}{(CF_{\\text{liquidated asset}})(1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}}\n$$\nHowever, in some cases where more than two assets are borrowed or deposited as collaterals, $RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}$ can exceed $DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}$ or $CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}$. In either case, repayment is not valid because repayment amount must be smaller than the debt and must be smaller than the captured collateral amount plus liquidation bonus in order for the liquidation to work.\nIn such cases, $\\text{Final Repaid Amount}_{\\text{repaid asset}}$ needs to be reduced down to $min(RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, min(DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, \\frac{CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}))$.\nBelow, we review all of the different possibilities for liquidation. We use $\\text{USDT} = \\text{repaid asset}$, and $\\text{TON} = \\text{liquidated asset}$.\n1. $\\text{HF} \\ge 1$\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor (liquidation threshold)80%85%\nDeposited amount in USD5.4 USD0.1 USD\nBorrowed amount in USD0.1 USD0 USD\nLiquidation bonus6%7%\n\nIn this case, there can't be a liquidation on this account, because the user's position is healthy:\n$$\n\\text{HF} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 5.4 + 0.85 \\times 0.1}{0.1} \\ge 1\n$$\n2. $\\text{HF} \\le 1$ and $RV_{\\text{repaid asset}} = min(RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, min(DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, \\frac{CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}))$\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor (liquidation threshold)80%85%\nDeposited amount in USD5.4 USD0.1 USD\nBorrowed amount in USD0.1 USD5 USD\nLiquidation bonus6%7%\n\nThis is the example we used previously. HF is smaller than 1:\n$$\n\\text{HF} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 5.4 + 0.85 \\times 0.1}{0.1 + 5} = \\frac{4.405}{5.1} \\le 1\n$$\nand $RV_{\\text{repaid asset}} = min(RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, min(DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, \\frac{CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}})$:\n$$\nRV_{\\text{repaid asset}} = \\frac{-\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}(\\sum\\limits_{i}{DV_i}) + \\sum\\limits_{i}{(CF_i \\times CV_i)}}{((CF_{\\text{liquidated asset}})(1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}})) - \\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\implies RV_{\\text{USDT}} = \\frac{-(1)(5 + 0.1) + (0.8 \\times 5.4 + 0.85 \\times 0.1)}{((0.8)(1 + 0.06)) - 1}\n$$\n$$\n\\implies RV_{\\text{USDT}} = 4.57236842105263...\n$$\n3. $\\text{HF} \\le 1$ and $\\text{Final Repaid Amount}_{\\text{repaid asset}} = \\frac{CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}} = min(RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, min(DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, \\frac{CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}})$\nPut simply, this is when the amount of collateral to be liquidated isn't enough to bring HF back to 1, because the user has multiple collaterals.\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor (liquidation threshold)80%85%\nDeposited amount in USD3 USD2.5 USD\nBorrowed amount in USD0.1 USD5 USD\nLiquidation bonus6%7%\n\nCalculate HF first:\n$$\n\\text{HF} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 3 + 0.85 \\times 2.5}{0.1 + 5} = \\frac{4.525}{5.1} \\le 1\n$$\n$$\nRV_{\\text{USDT}} = \\frac{-(1)(5 + 0.1) + (0.8 \\times 3 + 0.85 \\times 2.5)}{((0.8)(1 + 0.06)) - 1} = 3.7828947368421026...\n$$\n$$\n3.7828947368421026... \\ge CV_{TON} \\because CV_{TON} = 3\n$$\n$$\n3.7828947368421026... \\le DV_{USDT} \\because DV_{USDT} = 5\n$$\n$$\n\\implies \\text{Final Repaid Amount}_{USDT} = \\frac{CV_{\\text{TON}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{TON}}} = min(RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, min(DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, \\frac{CV_{\\text{TON}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{TON}}})\n$$\nTherefore, we can only repay $\\frac{3}{1 + LF_{\\text{TON}}} = \\frac{3}{1.06} = 2.830188679....$ in this scenario. HF will not be fully restored back to 1. The denominator exists to account for the liquidation bonus, so that we can get 3 USD as the value of captured collateral plus liquidation bonus, which is the maximum we can get from the deposited USDT collateral. But liquidation should still run regardless.\nHere's $\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}}$:\n$$\n\\text{HF}_{\\text{after liquidation}} = \\frac{CF_{TON} \\times (CV_{TON} - (\\text{Final Repaid Amount}_{USDT})(1 + LF_{\\text{TON}})) + CF_{USDT} \\times CV_{USDT}}{DV_{TON} + DV_{USDT} - \\text{Final Repaid Amount}_{USDT}}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{0 + CF_{USDT} \\times CV_{USDT}}{DV_{TON} + DV_{USDT} - \\text{Final Repaid Amount}_{USDT}}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{0 + 2.5 \\times 0.85}{5.1 - 2.5} = \\frac{2.125}{2.6} = 0.81730769....\n$$\nNotice that we will need to liquidate the other collateral to fully recover the health factor back to 1.\n4. $DV_{\\text{repaid asset}} = min(RV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, min(DV_{\\text{repaid asset}}, \\frac{CV_{\\text{liquidated asset}}}{1 + LF_{\\text{liquidated asset}}})$\nThis is when the amount of debt to be repaid isn't enough to bring HF back to 1 because the user has multiple assets in debt, and this amount is smaller than the collateral that can be captured.\nTONUSDT\nCollateral factor (liquidation threshold)80%85%\nDeposited amount in USD5.4 USD0.1 USD\nBorrowed amount in USD2.5 USD2.6 USD\nLiquidation bonus6%7%\n\nAgain, we are repaying USDT and liquidating TON:\n$$\nRV_{\\text{USDT}} = \\frac{-(1)(2.5 + 2.6) + (0.8 \\times 5.4 + 0.85 \\times 0.1)}{((0.8)(1 + 0.06)) - 1}\n$$\n$$\n= 4.57236842105263...\n$$\nThis means we want to liquidate 4.57236842105263 USD equivalent of USDT, but we cannot because the user only has 2.6 USD worth of USDT in debt, thus:\n$$\n\\text{Final repaid amount}_{USDT} = min(4.57236842105263, min(2.6, \\frac{5.4}{1.06}))\n$$\n$$\n= 2.6\n$$\nThis won't recover HF back to 1. It will require another liquidation to be run to repay TON and liquidate TON.\nDescribing the behavior in code\nThe entire codebase is available on github.com/9oelM/defi-lending-liquidation.

Then the first miner to solve the problem wins the right to add a new block to the chain.\nAfter The Merge, miners aren't needed anymore; instead, we call them 'validators' who help secure the network by committing their stake to validate the blocks.\nEach time a new block needs to be created, a validator is randomly selected to propose a block. Then other validators attest that they have observed the block creation. Then they respectively win rewards for proposing blocks and attesting to the new blocks.\nThe security mechanism is simple: each validator needs to be staked with at least 32 ETH, which is about 121,600 USD as of today. If a validator produces an invalid block, their stake is 'slashed', meaning that a part of their staked ETH will be taken away. This way, validators are incentivized to only engage in an honest behavior.\nStaking\nEver since then, 'staking' has become a very crucial and popular topic in crypto. What are we going to do with it? And how can we use it to earn extra economic benefits?\nThe easiest way was to stake ETH to a validator so people can earn extra ETH for validating the network.\nBut doing that completely alone is a difficult challenge:\n\nOne needs to have at least 32 ETH to stake.\nOne needs to operate and maintain the validator, which is a program running on a computer. If not carefully configured or maintained, it might lead to slashing.\n\nIn this respect, people came up with some better idea: staking as a service and pooled staking. In a nutshell, it means that the amount of ETH that one has doesn't disqualify him from staking it, and a specialized staking service provider will run a validator node for you. In exchange, they would take a certain percentage off of the yield from the validator, but still rewarding the users sufficiently.\nSome prime examples of pooled staking services are:\n\nLido\nRocket Pool\nSwell\n\nLiquid staking\nThe staking services soon realized that they can still keep the staked ETH in a liquid form, which could then be used in other places. It is a form of derivative because it does not represent the underlying ETH that one has. It is a representation of the staked ETH that one can withdraw if he wants to.\nThen, since this staked ETH represents the underlying ETH and the ability to withdraw it, it can be regarded almost as the same thing as the underlying ETH, except that there is an additional risk involved in staking, such as slashing, smart contracts, etc.\nThose who are willing to take a bit of additional risk can choose to use it in other DeFi applications. For example, Aave supports depositing or borrowing staked ETH:\n\nThis way, staked ETH is entirely kept in a liquid form, because it can be used just like its underlying asset, ETH.\nLiquid restaking and EigenLayer\n\nEthereum and decoupling of trust and innovation\nEthereum pioneered modular blockchains. It has different layers doing different things. It decoupled trust and innovation because anyone can bring any applications on top of Ethereum network. They are 'borrowing trust' from the underlying network. The applications themselves do not need to be trusted, because the underlying network is secured by the trust network.\n\nAlt-L1s fracture trust\nBut what if someone wants to build his own L1? This gives brith to different consensus protocols, different virtual machines, and so on. Then this again means fragmentation of trust because trust is fragmented across different blockchains.\n\nThen we also start to see modular blockchains. Ethereum has all components (or 'modules') of consensus, which are ordering, data availability, settlement, and execution layers. But we are now seeing new blockchains being built for one of the specific modules only.\nThis means you can build DApps comprised of arbitrary combination of these modules.\nModularity fractures trust\nBut who will be providing trust? Trust is missing here. Also, trust is fractured into smaller islands\n\nLet's say Ethereum trust network has 200bn USD staked. But if the execution layer of a DApp is based on a 10bn worth of trust only, that is the trust bottleneck and the weakest link. Therefore, the entire cost of corrupting these DApps is 10bn USD only.\nMiddlewares fracture trust\nOracles, bridges, ... anything that needs a distributed validation service needs its own trust network.\nThis is a barrier to innovation, because if you want to build your own oracle or bridge, you would need to build your own trust network, which is extremely difficult.\n\nThe problem\n\nMiddleware: need to generate certain % of revenue from the staked assets. Massive cost.\nDApps: need to rely on Ethereum as well as middlewares. Suffer from low and fragmented trust\nEthereum (L1): Instead of being a decentralized trust network, its value gets split across all of the applications.\n\nThe solution: EigenLayer\nThe mechanism by which the trust originating from Ethereum can be redirected into any new modules built by anyone. The core idea behind EigenLayer is restaking. You stake the liquid staking token again, subjecting yourself to an additional slashing conditions, but opting to provide new services. New distributed validation services but same validated network.\n\nHow does it improve the situation?\n\nMiddleware: no additional cost of capital. You are restaking, so you are not taking an additional cost of capital but at the same time are taking a certain yield from the original staking in Ethereum network.\nDApps: can solely rely on core Ethereum trust instead of fractured trust.\nEthereum: its inherent value increases. Restakers earn additional yield. Its trust network becomes more important. \n\nThe restaking collective\nEigenLayer is a set of smart contracts on Ethereum. EigenLayer allows stakers to opt in for greater yield while taking a greater risk.\nWhen a user stakes, he needs to set the withdrawal address as EigenLayer smart contract instead of a personal wallet address because if something goes wrong in the service that is provided with his restaked ETH, he might lose a part of his stake.\nInstead of securing different networks with a different trust mechanisms, now Ethereum steps in to secure it all. And that's only one trust network to rule them all, which is convenient and easy.\n\nNow the cost of capital used to secure Ethereum network only, can bring amortization of cost of capital, if it is used across multiple networks.\n\nEigenLayer wants to do the equivalent of rehypothecation in traditional finance: re-using previously pledged collateral as the collateral for a new loan. 1\n\nEigenLayer advantages\n\nIncreased security for protocols: protocols (or AVS, actively validated services) are now sharing Ethereum's immense security without having to launch their own trust networks.\nProtocol governance: there are serious tradeoffs in protocol governance directions. Agility is fast, but democracy is slow. But we can combine these two. Ethereum is stable, and EigenLayer allows protocols to control the amount of pooled security needed and validators to control the amount they supply. It is a competitive economic market of security. For example, one AVS might say, it needs only 1 stETH to validate what it is doing because what it is doing is trivial and is worth only of 1 stETH's security. Another AVS might say, it needs 100 stETH to validate what it is doing because it is a critical service. This is a democracy, but it is also agile.\n\n\n\nImproved capital efficiency: no need to create a new token, trust network, bootstrap custom validators, etc. The capital can be used somewhere else.\n\n\nSwell\nSwell is a non-custodial liquid staking/restaking protocol built on Ethereum. It used to only support ETH staking, but from January 2024, it began to support native restaking to EigenLayer.\nRestaking unlocks new opportunities for stakers: they no longer have to lock their liquidity in EigenLayer by restaking their liquid staking token like swETH. Instead, Swell mints rswETH (restaked Swell Eth) when you restake your swETH.\nThen, rswETH can just be used like ETH, transferred around or deposited into another DeFi protocol.\n\n\nReferences\n1\n[Bankless] Vitalik’s Warning and EigenLayer's Promise \n\n\n[Coinbase] Restaking: Everything Old is New Again\n[Coinbase] Understanding the EigenLayer AVS Landscape\n[Consensys] EigenLayer: Decentralized Ethereum Restaking Protocol Explained\n[Ethereum] The Merge\n[Four pillars] Swell, L2 for the Optimal Restaking Experience\n[EigenLayer Forum] Learn about EigenLayer\n[Medium] Liquid Restaking Wars: the Next Lido\n[Renzo] Renzo FAQs\n[Substack] Eigenlayer | What Is It?\n[Swell Blog] Swell L2 Pre-Launch Deposits | Space Recap\n[Swell Blog] What is Restaking?\n[Swell Blog] AVS Selection Framework\n[Swell Blog] Swell Collaborates with AltLayer, EigenDA, and Chainlink to Launch L2 for Restaking with Polygon CDK\n[Swell Blog] 3 Things You Need to Know About rswETH v2\n[Twitter] Abi's description of Swell L2\n[Twitter] Swell Network; a Deep Dive into the Most Interesting L2 by Kairos Research\n[Youtube] Sreeram Kannan — EigenLayr: Permissionless Feature Addition to Ethereum (ETHconomics @ Devconnect)\n[Youtube] Bankless: EigenLayer with Sreeram Kannan\n[Vitalik] Don't overload Ethereum's consensus\n\n","id":"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/making-sense-of-liquid-restaking/","title":"Making sense of liquid restaking"},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/making-sense-of-starknet-architecture-and-l1-l2-messaging/":{"body":"With the introduction of the STRK provisions program, Starknet has garnered significant public attention, sparking a growing curiosity regarding its technical intricacies. Particularly, there exists a notable gap in understanding the architecture of Starknet and the mechanics of L1-L2 messaging. Thus, the purpose of this writing is to provide a comprehensive elucidation of these two topics.\nStarknet architecture\nLet us start by defining the architecture of Starknet. Starknet consists of several components:\n\nMempool (Gateway)\nSequencer\nProver\nFull node\nStarknet core contract\nVerifier\nStarknet bridge contract\n\nMempool (Gateway)\nA mempool (memory pool) is a temporary storage for pending transactions that are not included in a block yet. When you submit a transaction, it doesn't go straight into the network and make changes. It will have to wait in the mempool.\nThe mempool performs a preliminary validation on the transaction, like checking the length of calldata.\n\nSequencer\nSequencer retrieves transactions from mempool and puts them in a specific sequential order, and produces blocks containing them.\nIn essence, a sequencer has two core tasks1: \n\nsequencing (ordering): it orders transactions, determining the canonical sequence of blocks for a given chain fork. It then appends new blocks to this sequence.\nexecuting (validation): it executes these transactions, updating the system’s state based on a given function. The block produced by the sequencer is submitted to Ethereum as a single compact proof (aka \"rollup\").\n\nStarknet has some open-source sequencers:\n\nMandara\nBlockifier\nKraken (seemingly discontinued by Lambdaclass)\n\nA sequencer is needed in L2 blockchains for scalability and performance wins. By processing transactions off-chain in batches, it is able to achieve much faster speed. \nBlockchains may have a centralized sequencer, like Starknet. The centralized sequencer can function as perfectly as a decentralized one. But the primary drive for the decentralization comes from mitigating the risk of censorship, because transactions can be reordered, included, or excluded by a centralized party without no one noticing it. In light of this, Starknet is actively moving towards decentralization, as described by their blog post in Oct 2023, although the sequencer is likely to be one of the last components in the stack to be decentralized.\nFull node\nStarknet has a few full node implementations:\n\nPathfinder\nJuno\nPapyrus\n\nThe full node is responsible for handling all API requests specified per spec.\nProver\nThe prover generates proofs for the transactions in the blocks produced by the sequencer. cairo-vm is used as a prover. Another implementation is cairo-vm-go.\nThe prover receives blocks from the sequencer, and processes each block to assert the correctness, and generates proof, and submits the proof to Ethereum.\nStarknet uses SHARP, which stands for a SHARed Prover. It is:\n\na powerful system designed to generate STARK proofs for aggregated Cairo programs. Cairo, being a general computation programming language, allows for the accommodation of various code logics in one single proof. \n\n\nSHARP processes batches of transactions off-chain, and validates the proof for their computation on-chain, amortizing the cost of all transactions across a single proof. The generated unified STARK proof is validated through an on-chain Solidity verifier contract, enabling SHARP to enhance throughput, reduce gas fees, and minimize latency.2\n\nIn other words, different Cairo programs are run together and a single proof for all of those programs are generated. Here's a good read on on SHARP.\nVerifier\nStarknet manages a verifier smart contract on Ethereum responsible for verifying the proof generated from the Cairo VM.&nbsp;If the proof is valid, Starknet's state root is updated to the newest one. The verification and state transition can be seen at https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/efa9648f57568aad8f8a13fbf027d2de7c63c2c0/src/starkware/starknet/solidity/Starknet.sol#L286.\nStarknet core contract\nThe Starknet core contract is an Ethereum contract deployed at 0xc662c410C0ECf747543f5bA90660f6ABeBD9C8c4 at time of writing. The source code can be viewed at Starknet.sol.\nThe core contract:\n\nstores the list of verifier contracts\nmanages L1-L2 messaging\noversees state commitment and update between L1 and L2\n\nStarknet bridge contract\nWhen we say 'Starknet bridge contract', it means multiple contracts that work together to enable bridging. Bridging mean not only the transfer of a token, but also any arbitrary messages between Ethereum and Starknet.\nThe bridge contracts can be located at:\n\nLegacyBridge.sol: the old bridge contract that used to be deployed per token. Still in use by most prominent tokens on Starknet, like wBTC, USDC, USDT, and more.\nStarknetTokenBridge.sol: the new bridge contract that is used to bridge multiple tokens with just one contract. Adding a token is permissionless.\nStarkgateManager.sol: manager contract that oversees tokens bridged by StarknetTokenBridge.sol. Can deactivate or block a token, enroll a new token, etc.\nStarkgateRegistry.sol: maintains the list of bridged tokens.\ntoken_bridge.cairo: the bridge contract on L2 that is compatible with both LegacyBridge.sol and StarknetTokenBridge.sol. Users submit withdraw requests from here. L1 bridges use this L2 contract to deposit tokens into L2. More on this later.\n\nArchitecture diagram\nBelow diagram helps understand how these components work together.\n\n\nFirst, the user creates and submits a transaction to the mempool. Ths sequencer picks up the transactions from the mempool, orders, validates and executes them using Cairo VM. The Cairo program execution yields an execution trace, aggregating all the transactions appearing in that block to it. The execution trace, along with the previous state root, is fed into the prover.\nThe prover, again using Cairo VM, generates a new state root and proof based on the data received from the sequencer. Then it passes those to the verifier contract. The Starknet core contract verifies the validity of the state update, and if it is valid, it updates the state. Then the user's transaction is successfully accepted on L1.\nNow that we know how Starknet works, we are ready to talk about L1-L2 messaging. The Starknet bridge contract in the diagram deliberately has not been elaborated in this section for that reason.\nL1-L2 messaging\nOverview\nHere's an overview of L1-L2 messaging on Starknet. Here's a diagram from Starknet's official documentation:\n\nKeep this in mind, as we are going to go through each step in detail in words. Then you can fully grasp the concept by coming back to this diagram later.\nLegacyBridge (LegacyBridge.sol)\nStarknet used to have a bridge per token. This means that for every single token that was meant to be bridged, the same bridge has to be deployed again. This bridge is still live in production and still serves most of the bridge tokens to this date. The list of tokens that make use of LegacyBridge can be discovered at https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-addresses/blob/master/bridged_tokens/mainnet.json.\nSome of them are:\n\nYou can see that each token's bridge address is different from one another, which means that LegacyBridge is only limited to one deployment per token.\nMultiBridge (StarknetTokenBridge.sol)\nBut deploying a bridge per token is quite troublesome, isn't it? Ideally, it would be nice if a single bridge can handle multiple number of tokens, which means you don't need to deploy a bridge every single time you want to bridge a new token.\nThis bridge is the latest standard on Starknet for any newer tokens on Starknet. Any new tokens looking for being bridged should use this contract instead.\nThe deployment of this bridge is managed by the StarkWare team themselves, so all you need to do is to enroll a token and use this bridge.\nEnroll a token bridge\nThe first thing to be done is to create an ERC20 token on Ethereum. The reason we don't do it on Starknet is that Starknet bridge contract is going to create an ERC20 contract on Starknet for us automatically once we enroll a token bridge.\nOnce you have your Ethereum ERC20 token address ready, you can use it to call enrollTokenBridge. Enrolling a new token bridge is permissionless. This means anyone can submit a transaction to enroll a new token bridge for any token with a small gas fee:\n\nThis relates to a few other contracts, namely StarkgateRegistry.sol and StarkgateBridge.sol (which is in fact inherited by Starknet core contract, Starknet.sol).\nLet us look at the implementation of registryContract.enlistToken(token, bridge()):\n\nIt checks if there is an existing bridge for a token, or a blocked token. If it passes that check, the bridge address is assigned to the corresponding token key in the tokenToBridge mapping. This way, the registry contract maintains a mapping of token to bridge mapping.\nThen, it calls enrollToken:\n\nIn sendDeployMessage, sendMessageL2 is called, and the sequencer will pick up deployMessagePayload(token) and send it to the relevant l1_handler represented by HANDLE_TOKEN_DEPLOYMENT_SELECTOR at the contract address of l2TokenBridge() on L2:\n\n\nThe only important line is deploy_syscall(class_hash, l1_token.into(), calldata.span(), false).unwrap_syscall();. You are deploying a new ERC20 contract, which has initially been triggered by your call to enrollTokenBridge.\nOnce this is complete, you will have an ERC20 contract on Starknet that corresponds to yours on Ethereum, joined together by Starknet bridge contract.\nTransfer a token from L1 to L2 (deposit)\nFor a token using the legacy bridge, either call function deposit(uint256 amount, uint256 l2Recipient) or deposit(address token, uint256 amount, uint256 l2Recipient). The legacy bridge is designed to support the legacy function with only two parameters for backward compatibility as well as the newest function signature with three parameters:\n\nHere's an example transaction that deposits 69915.000000 USDC:\n\nFor a token that uses the new bridge, call deposit(address token,uint256 amount,uint256 l2Recipient). The new bridge, also called MultiBridge, is capable of handling multiple tokens with just one bridge, unlike the legacy bridge. It is deployed at 0xF5b6Ee2CAEb6769659f6C091D209DfdCaF3F69Eb on Ethereum.\nHere's an example transaction that deposits 1,277.777777777777777776 ZEND:\n\nDo note that l2recipient is a uint256 variable because felt252 needs to fit in the variable. address won't do it because it's only 20 bytes, whereas felt252 will need 31 bytes. uint256 containing 32 bytes is deemed to be a suitable choice to contain felt252 variable. For those who are new with Starknet, felt252 is a variable type that can be declared in Cairo that is used to represent many things on Starknet.\nDeposit code examination\nNow, let's examine the deposit function. The legacy and new ones essentially function in the same way, so we will only look into the new function.\n\nFirst, notice that the function is payable, although we are depositing an ERC20 token. This is because we need to use Ether as a fee for deposit. The fee will be used by the sequencer to send the message to L2. The gas used in the deposit transaction cannot be directly used as a fee for depositing into L2. 3\nThen, acceptDeposit checks if the fee is enough and transfers the specified amount of token into the contract:\n\nThe allowed range of fee is in fact hardcoded into Fee contract.\n\nThis implies that it's not actually an estimation, but just a hardcoded value. So you don't need to call estimateDepositFee to 'estimate' it. You can just hardcode your fee at some small amount of Ether that falls within MIN_FEE and MAX_FEE.\nAfter checking the fee, we call sendDepositMessage:\n\nrequire(l2TokenBridge() != 0, \"L2_BRIDGE_NOT_SET\"); checks whether the L2 bridge address is set. In the case of MultiBridge, this will be the corresponding MultiBridge contract (token_bridge.cairo) on Starknet, currently deployed at 0x0616757a151c21f9be8775098d591c2807316d992bbc3bb1a5c1821630589256.\nThen, we make sure the amount is non-zero by writing require(amount &gt; 0, \"ZERO_DEPOSIT\").\nThe next line is possible due to using UintFelt252 for uint256; directive at the top of the contract code. UintFelt252 is a small library to manage Felt252 data type. So we just make sure that l2Recipient is a valid L2 address by writing require(l2Recipient.isValidL2Address(), \"L2_ADDRESS_OUT_OF_RANGE\");.\nIf you have been following well, you should notice that bool isWithMsg = selector == HANDLE_DEPOSIT_WITH_MESSAGE_SELECTOR; should be false, because the selector that is being passed down is HANDLE_TOKEN_DEPOSIT_SELECTOR which is not HANDLE_DEPOSIT_WITH_MESSAGE_SELECTOR because we don't have any message - it is an empty array.\n\nWe create a payload using depositMessagePayload function. Everything that is relevant to the transaction (in this case, deposit) that the user is making needs to be included in the payload, because it will be an input to generate a hash that represents L1 to L2 message hash. \nFailure to include all relevant information in the payload will result in a message hash from which certain information cannot be confirmed. For example, if you deposited 500 USDC but if the amount of 500 USDC is not reflected in the hash, there is no proof on blockchain that you deposited 500 USDC anymore.\nWhen withMessage == false, the payload would be [token, msg.sender, l2Recipient, amountLow, amountHigh]. The reason we encode the amount into low and high variables is that the amount is a variable of type uint256, which means it cannot be represented by felt252 which is only 31 bytes. To be able to represent that information on Starknet, we divide it into two variables, which would have been fine if we were to only care about Ethereum.\nIf withMessage == true, the payload would contain [token, msg.sender, l2Recipient, amountLow, amountHigh, message.length, message[0], message[1], ..., message[message.length - 2], message[message.length - 1]]. As such, a user can send an arbitrary length of message along with the token.\nFinally, we call sendMessageToL2 from the Starknet core contract. Let's look at how sendMessageToL2 is implemented in that contract:\n\nThe function first increments the nonce. The nonce is very important in this context, because it prevents the transactions of the same payload to be differentiated from one another. Remember that the payload can contain [token, msg.sender, l2Recipient, amountLow, amountHigh] in its simplest form. Then, if the msg.sender sends the same amount of a token to the same l2Recipient more than once, the same message hash will be produced if a unique nonce is not included in the hash.\nAfter incrementing the nonce, the hash is derived by using getL1ToL2MsgHash:\n\nNotice that everything related to the current transaction is included in the hash to avoid any hash collisions.\nOnce Starknet sequencer detects the transaction by waiting for enough L1 confirmations for it, it initiates the desired L2 transaction by invoking the relevant function in token_bridge.cairo marked with #[l1_handler].\nDepending on the existence of the message, the sequencer will pick up the transaction and call handle_deposit or handle_deposit_with_message:\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that only_from_l1_bridge asserts that the deposit is always from the L1 bridge. l1_handler's first parameter is always the address of the L1 contract that initiated the transaction, which is being used to validate only_from_l1_bridge. Failure to do so will directly result in a security vulnerability, because anyone can forge a deposit payload and call sendMessageToL2 in the Starknet core contract with it. That means anyone might be able to mint a token to L2 without having to prove that they have a token on L1. \nThe only authoritative deposit is from the L1 bridge, which is a separate contract from the core contract. The L1 bridge could be any of the addresses specified as l1_bridge_address at https://github.com/starknet-io/starknet-addresses/blob/master/bridged_tokens/mainnet.json.\nIn case of handle_token_deposit, we just need to increase the token balance of the l2_recipient. This is done by handle_deposit_common:\n\npermissioned_mint is a function that is present in the ERC20 contract deployed by Starknet core contract. We will cover this later on. For now, it's enough to know that it mints a token to l2_recipient.\nIf a deposit contains a message, handle_deposit_with_message will be invoked instead. After calling handle_deposit_common, the next procedure is just invoking on_receive of l2_recipient with the calldata containing the information about the deposit, which is [l2_token, amount, depositor, message].\nThis feature is called 'smart deposit', where the deposit moves funds from L1 to L2 and then triggers subsequent actions. If on_receive isn't implemented or fails to return true, handle_deposit_with_message will not succeed, and the fund will have to be recovered with depositWithMessageCancelRequest because there is no way it can be received by l2_recipient anymore.\nOnce one of these l1_handlers successfully run, the l2_recipient should be able to see the increase in the amount of the token on its wallet.\nLater on, l1ToL2Messages are processed altogether at the same time at the Starknet core contract, when the state is being updated to reflect the relevant transaction that just happened on L2:\n\nThe programOutput is the execution result of StarkNet OS program that encompasses multiple Cairo programs that were processed at a time.\n\nprocessMessages will enter the else branch at line 116. Then, msgFeePlusOne for each message will be accessed to add to totalMsgFees. Right after that, messages[messageHash] = 0 to specify that the corresponding message has been consumed to L2.\nTransfer a token from L2 to L1 (withdraw)\nThe withdrawal begins by calling either initiate_withdraw or initiate_token_withdraw in token_bridge.cairo:\n\nHere's a transaction that calls initiate_withdraw for 207.59 USDC:\n\nDo note that this is from some time ago, on Feb 9, 2023, which is the reason that the transaction is a call to the legacy function initiate_withdraw. But the upgraded legacy bridges also now support initiate_token_withdraw, which has the exact same functionality. Although the legacy function still works, it is left there for backward compatibility. Any new applications should strive to use initiate_token_withdraw wherever possible.\nSo here's a transaction that calls initiate_token_withdraw on 54230 USDC:\n\nMainly, two things are happening:\n\nThe L2 token is being burnt by permissioned_burn.\nA message is being sent to L1 by send_message_to_l1_syscall. The message payload always contains [0, l1_recipient, l1_token, amount]. 0 is used to mean a 'transfer from Starknet'.\n\nOnce the message arrives at L1, its hash will be stored in l2ToL1Messages (which in the body of function processMessages below, is supplied as a parameter called messages):\n\nStarknet core contract will iterate through every message from L2 to L1 and store each in its messageHash. We observe that messages[messageHash] += 1; because we want to signify that the message has been received. It is possible that messages[messageHash] &gt; 1 in case of the same withdrawal request. Also, note that we do not have a nonce here unlike deposit. The reason is that we don't need to differentiate one withdrawal from another if they are of the same l1_recipient, l1_token and amount. \nAs for deposit, nonce makes each instance of deposit unique. For example, if you deposited 500 USDC at 3PM and another 500 USDC at 4PM with the exact same l2_recipient, somehow the deposit at 4PM might have worked and 3PM might have not. In that case, the two deposits are not the 'same' anymore, and the distinct instance of deposit at 3PM needs to be cancelled. As per the dev's comment:\n\nOn the other hand, withdrawal cannot be cancelled, so there is no reason to keep track of nonce for it.\nOnce processMessages is triggered by the sequencer to update the state, the withdrawal request should now be placed in l2ToL1Messages. If so, recipient at L1 can now call withdraw to claim the bridged token:\n\nWe can see that consumeMessage just creates the payload that we saw in initiate_token_withdraw already and calls consumeMessageFromL2. TRANSFER_FROM_STARKNET is set to 0, which is in line with what we have done on L2:\n\nFinally, consumeMessageFromL2 at Starknet core contract derives the hash with keccak256(abi.encodePacked(fromAddress, uint256(uint160(msg.sender)), payload.length, payload)). If the hash exists, we subtract 1 away from l2ToL1messages[msgHash] to tell that this msgHash has been fully consumed.\n\n\n\nOnce the message is consumed, the fund is transferred to the recipient suing transferOutFunds. At this point the recipient should be able to see a change in the balance on its wallet.\nIndexing withdrawal initiations\nNow, if you are an dApp builder who wants to provide withdrawal functionality to users, you would need to track the calls to initiate_token_withdraw at L2 because users will need to use the parameters of initiate_token_withdraw as an input to generate message hash to access l2ToL1messages later on L1.\nThis means you would need some off-chain indexer that does this. You can simply keep track of the event emitted from initiate_token_withdraw, which is:\n\nThen, the indexer would at times query l2ToL1messages[msgHash] to see if the message is ready for consumption at L1 by constructing msgHash from the information given from WithdrawInitiated events. If l2ToL1messages[msgHash] &gt; 0, the frontend can display an option to submit a transaction for withdraw at L2.\nIn fact, this is the current implementation of Starkgate, a full-stack bridge software maintained by StarkWare. It constantly checks if you have a pending withdrawal by querying an off-chain indexer hosted at starkgate.starknet.io/transfer-log/api/* once you enter the website and connect your wallets:\n\nOnce it detects that you have a pending withdrawal, you will have a little toast that tells you to submit a transaction to complete the withdrawal of your fund on L1.\nWithdrawal limit\nThe Starknet bridge contract implements something called 'withdrawal limit' or 'withdrawal quota'. So far we have seen a few lines of code where it enforces some rule related to it, but didn't bother to explain there.\nThe withdrawal limit can be enabled by a designated security agent only. This means even ERC20 token contract owners cannot enforce a withdrawal limit. It is only enabled when the security determines that there is a serious security issue that may bring about withdrawals of unsual amount.\n\nReferences\n1\nhttps://book.starknet.io/ch03-02-sequencers.html\n\n2\nhttps://starkware.co/resource/joining-forces-sharp/\n\n3\nhttps://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Network_Architecture/messaging-mechanism/#l1-l2-message-fees\n\n\nThe Starknet Book\nMandara architecture\nJoining Forces: SHARP - Save Costs and Enhance Ethereum’s Scalability: If it’s Written in Cairo, SHARP Can Prove it\nStarknet Community Call #35 | SHARP - the backbone of Starknet\nSHARP: StarkWare's Shared Prover | Kineret Segal\nStarknet Glossary\nTransaction lifecycle\nStarknet architecture review\nStarknet architecture\n\n","id":"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/making-sense-of-starknet-architecture-and-l1-l2-messaging/","title":"Making sense of Starknet architecture and L1-L2 Messaging"}},"docInfo":{"https://lazer1.xyz/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/":{"body":1,"title":1},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/crash-course-on-the-state-of-restaking-2025/":{"body":1782,"title":5},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/how-jettons-work-on-ton-with-sharding-in-mind-part-1/":{"body":2211,"title":7},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/how-jettons-work-on-ton-with-sharding-in-mind-part-2/":{"body":917,"title":7},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/liquidation-math-on-a-defi-lending-protocol-how-much-to-liquidate/":{"body":2063,"title":7},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/making-sense-of-liquid-restaking/":{"body":903,"title":4},"https://lazer1.xyz/blog/making-sense-of-starknet-architecture-and-l1-l2-messaging/":{"body":1993,"title":7}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
